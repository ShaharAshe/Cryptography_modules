1. When you have `d` and `e` and you looking for a divisor of `n`, you will use: `universal_exponent_algorithm.py`.
2. When you have `e` and divisors of `n` - `q and p`, and you want to find `d`, you will use: `RSA_calc_key.py`.
3. When you have `d` and divisors of `n` - `q and p`, and you want to find `e`, you will use: `RSA_calc_key.py`.
4. When you are asked to find the secret `(d)` or public `(e)` key by Euclid you should put `phi` and `e` or `d`.
5. In number_of_creators.py you shuld use `(p-1)`.
